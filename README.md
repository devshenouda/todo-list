# To-Do List Web Application

A simple, interactive To-Do list web app that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. The tasks are stored in the browser using **localStorage**, ensuring that they persist even after page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button (or pressing Enter).
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. The task will be crossed out.
- **Remove Tasks**: Double-click on a task to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved to **localStorage** so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error (red border) if the input field is empty when adding a task.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and adding a modern, clean look.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the functionality, such as adding/removing tasks, and saving/loading tasks to/from **localStorage**.
